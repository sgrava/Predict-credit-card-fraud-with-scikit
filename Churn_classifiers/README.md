### Customer churn analysis with different classifiers

In this notebook we will build a model to predict, based on the available data, if a customer of a telecom company will churn, with roughly 95% accuracy. 

The model will use a well-known classification algorithm, the [k-nearest neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) (KNN), which simply look at the k closest labeled data point and takes a majority vote.

The notebook is organized as follows:
1. Exploratory analysis to clean, format and visualize the data
2. Data preprocessing
3. Building the KNN model
4. Test it and evaluate its performance.
5. Explore different classifiers.
